Hi! I'm Helena, a software engineer currently based in the Chicago area. After receiving a degree in Chemical Engineering, I spent the last few years working in the oil and gas industry. I loved the problem solving aspect of chemical engineering and finding unique solutions to complicated problems for a variety of clients. 

During the pandemic, I began learning Python in the summer of 2020 which reignited my passion for coding. I love solving puzzles and coding lets me spend my entire day solving puzzles. I decided to make a career change and solidified my skills through a 17-week immersive coding bootcamp at Grace Hopper (a women+ program at Fullstack Academy). I am now looking for a job that can benefit from my engineering mindset, leadership experience, and creative problem solving.
